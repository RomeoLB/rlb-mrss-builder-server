# rlb-mrss-builder-server
Node application to build a Video/Image MRSS feed and serve it from a Brightsign player

This application allows the user to upload image and video files to a specific folder via the player DWS (Diagnostic Web Server) and then from a control page specify the display time for displaying the images and then generate the MRSS feed to be served locally with the click of a couple of buttons.  

Who would want to use this application?:

- Users who do not want to use BrightAuthor (after the initial publish) for content update
- Users who just want to upload and delete files from a folder for content update
- Users who want to setup a MRSS builder/server but who don't know how to do so ( https://docs.brightsign.biz/space/DOC/2036105242/Developers)

2. Insert the SD card with the unziped file in a Brightsign player (whilst thepower connector is unplugged)
3. Insert the power connector in the player and wait for the player to display at the bottom of the screen the URL for the control page
